# 🎯 Dart OOP Beginner Projects: Learn by Doing!

Welcome to this collection of **beginner-friendly Dart projects** designed to help you master the **core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — the Dart way 🚀

These projects are hands-on, practical, and perfect if you’re just starting to learn:

- ✅ Classes
- ✅ Objects
- ✅ Constructors (default, named, and with `this`)
- ✅ Methods inside classes
- ✅ Multi-file Dart programs

## 📁 What's Inside

Each project is a bite-sized Dart program focusing on one main idea. Here's the breakdown:

| Project Folder        | What It Covers                                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `01_simple_class/`    | Basic class creation and object instantiation |
| `02_constructor/`     | Using constructors to initialize objects      |
| `03_camera_info/`     | Real-world example using a Camera class       |
| `04_named_constructor/` | Using named constructors in Dart           |
| `05_method_logic/`    | Adding custom methods like `priceHigh()`      |

## 🧠 Why This Project Exists

Because reading theory is boring. You need to **see the code**, **run it**, and **tweak it** to understand it.

These mini-projects are built to:

- Reinforce your understanding of OOP in Dart
- Help you break that “beginner freeze”
- Show you real use-cases like camera objects, simple calculations, and printing data

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Dart SDK installed
- Basic terminal or VS Code knowledge
